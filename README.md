# Rosa-Virtual-Machine

In my five-day holiday, I have finished one of the most valuable functions of this virtual machine, the Continuously Concurrent Copying Collector. It's a kind of pause-less garbage collector which means it doesn't depend on the stop-the-world phase ! ! !

At present, it just like a toy. In order to make this toy more funny, I won't stop improving and optimizing it.
